# SOQL Caching

SOQL caching is more complex than it seems. To make it robust and bug-proof, we made the following assumptions:

## Records are stored in the cache as a List. The cache key is the SObjectType.

Key: `Profile`

Records:

| Id | Name | UserType |
| -- | ---- | -------- |
| 00e3V000000DhteQAC | Standard Guest | Guest |
| 00e3V000000DhteQAC | Standard Guest | Guest |
| 00e3V000000DhtfQAC | Community Profile | Guest |
| 00e3V000000NmefQAC | Standard User | Standard |
| 00e3V000000Nme3QAC | System Administrator | Standard |
| 00e3V000000NmeAQAS | Standard Platform User | Standard |
| 00e3V000000NmeHQAS | Customer Community Plus User | PowerCustomerSuccess |
| 00e3V000000NmeNQAS | Customer Community Plus Login User | PowerCustomerSuccess |

**Why not just cache by SOQL String?**

`SELECT Id, Name FROM Profile` => List of Profiles.

There are several reasons why caching by SOQL string is not the best approach:
1. **Identical Queries Treated Differently**
Even the same SOQL query can be treated as different due to variations in the string format.
For instance, `SELECT Id, Name FROM Profile` and `SELECT Name, Id FROM Profile` are identical in intent but differ in query string format. This issue becomes even more complex when dealing with `WHERE` conditions.
2. **Duplicate Entries and Inefficient Record Retrieval**
A simple query like `SELECT Id, Name FROM Profile` is a subset of a more complex query like `SELECT Id, Name, UserType FROM Profile`.
If the results of `SELECT Id, Name, UserType FROM Profile` are already cached, the simpler query should ideally retrieve the relevant data from the cache. However, if the cache uses the query string as the key, this wonâ€™t work, leading to duplication and inefficiency.
3. **Cache Storage Limitations**
Cache storage is limited. If different variations of queries continually add new entries to the cache, it can quickly fill up with redundant or overlapping records, reducing overall effectiveness.

## A query requires a single condition, and that condition must filter by a unique field.

To ensure that cached records are aligned with the database, a single condition is required.
A query without a condition cannot guarantee that the number of records in the cache matches the database.
Let assume that developer made the query: `SELECT Id, Name FROM Profile`. Cached records will be returned, which may differ from the records in the database.
